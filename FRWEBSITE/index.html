        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
          I couldn’t believe it. My time had come. My starting job,
        beginning as a nobody. A nobody from Cincinnati, Ohio. My dad passed
        away from a brain tumor when I was thirteen. Four days before my first
        organized game of football. My mom told me to play the game, it was what
        he’d have wanted. I played quarterback, and she told me the first thing
        I should do when I go out on that field is to point up to the heavens
        where my dad is. I did, and I’ve never stopped. I threw for 79 yards and
        a touchdown. My touchdown went to my best bud, Harry Freeman. Until
        college, he played receiver and running back, but he took on full
        wideout duties when we graduated high school. My dad would’ve been proud
        of that game. I went on to high school, and was touted as a five-star
        recruit. I threw for over 4,000 yards every season, from freshman year
        to adulthood, and my senior year, I threw a blistering 55 touchdowns. I
        also ran for 16 on the ground. When asked how I did so well, I always
        answered with the same response. It got me in trouble with reporters on
        multiple occasions. After a game in which I threw 6 touchdowns (four of
        them to Harry), a hot reporter with three camera guys asked me, “Sam…
        everyone’s been wondering the same thing: how do you manage to be so
        explosive? I mean, 6 touchdowns, no interceptions, 455 yards.. A very
        clean game. How do you manage it week in and week out?” “Well, pretty
        lady,” I said, looking up at the stars twinkling above us. “My dad has
        been watching over me since I was thirteen and I started my first game.
        I just know his hand is behind every ball I throw, and he guides me to
        the end zone. I could tell more, if you went to dinner.. Say, tomorrow
        night? On me?” The reporter looked at me. “Um, Sam. That’s not what I’m
        here for. How does your dad help you? Plus, Sam. I have a boyfriend.” I
        stopped her, putting up a hand. That boyfriend comment upset me. “Look,
        reporter lady. I’m the one winning games, I know how I do so well. You
        wanna go out tomorrow night, or not?” She looked at me disgustedly, then
        turned on her heel and walked away.
        <h3> Chapter 2</h3> 
        Not only did I do well on the high school field, but I got a full ride to Ohio State University. I
        was ecstatic. My dad’s favorite team for years was the Buckeyes (his
        favorite NFL team was the 49ers, nobody asked him how he got that one,
        but I followed along). I could remember sitting down on the couch with
        him week after week, yelling at the screen in imitation of the dad who I
        so looked up to. My dad used to play, too. He played quarterback, but he
        was never recruited seriously coming out of college. No wonder he loved
        the game so much. I attribute my passing skill to him, going outside
        after each and every game we watched and practicing long-throwing.
        Anyway. On the college field? I became even better. Nobody could stop
        me. I had a cannon for an arm, and I was lightning on my feet. Heisman
        finalist in my freshman year. My mom pressured me to major in something
        else, just in case football fell through, but I was on the clouds. Every
        game, I’d head out of the tunnel, point to the sky where my dad sat
        smiling, and torch the other team. It was easy. Michigan, Clemson,
        Wisconsin, I lost three games all my college career. Won two National
        Championships, sophomore and junior years. Harry benefited too. Of my
        121 touchdowns in my three years in college, 84 of them went to Harry.
        He and I were the powerhouse of the NCAA.
        <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
        College was also where I met Caitlin. She hated me for the longest time, but she came
        around. With help from Harry. Caitlin Myers was a physical therapy
        student at OSU while I was there. She was not the first girl I went out
        with, but she was the prettiest, and definitely the most serious
        relationship I’d been in. She came to every game. My final year of
        college, I declared for the draft. To my knowledge, there were about
        four teams willing to sell the farm for a top-tier quarterback: the New
        Orleans Saints, the Los Angeles Chargers, the Shibata Shoguns, and the
        Puerto Rico
